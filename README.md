## How to Start a Node.js Application using npm start
If you've just cloned a Node.js application from Git, you'll need to start the application to see it in action. Here's a quick guide to get you started.

## Prerequisites
Before you can start the application, you'll need to have the following installed on your machine:

Node.js
npm
## Getting Started
First, navigate to the root directory of the cloned application in your terminal.

Install the application's dependencies by running the following command:

```
npm install
```
This command will install all the dependencies listed in the package.json file.

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the application by running:

```
npm start
```
This command will run the start script defined in the package.json file. The start script typically launches the application and listens for incoming requests.

If everything is set up correctly, you should see a message in your terminal indicating that the application is running.


```
App listening on port 8080
```

Note that the port number may be different depending on how the application is configured.

You can now access the application by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:8080 (or the appropriate port number).

## Postman

I would like to inform you that as part of the documentation for this application, a Postman collection has been included in the doc folder. This collection can be used to test the different endpoints and functionalities of the application.

## Conclusion
That's it! You should now be able to start a Node.js application using npm start after cloning the code from Git. If you encounter any issues, make sure to check the application's documentation and error messages for troubleshooting steps.
